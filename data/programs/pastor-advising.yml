  On May 12, 2020 Impact Ministry began "**Faith in Action**," a 6-week
  prerequisite course to Impact's 12-week **Level 1 Associate Chaplain
  Certification Training Course**. Concurrently, Pastor Eddie taught the class,
  "**Criminals and Gang Members Anonymous (CGA)**" a 12-step-based program he
  co-founded in 2005 while incarcerated in the CA state prison system.


  Impact Ministry hopes to offer a 12-week, Level 1 Associate Chaplain Certification Training course beginning Summer 2021, depending on how our county progresses through COVID. Impactâ€™s goal is to offer all three levels of the Chaplain Certification Training Program in 2021-2022; Associate Chaplain, Chaplain, and Minister.
