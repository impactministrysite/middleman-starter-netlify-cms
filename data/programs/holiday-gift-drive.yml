  In 2018, lead SB County Jail Chaplain Dan Gaither and Pastor Eddie Perez
  baptized the first 12 women. This “founders group” purposed to gift every
  woman in the jail with a Christmas “Commissary Bag.” Impact Ministry raised
  the needed funds from generous donors and now supports an Annual Christmas
  Celebration—2020 marked the first year Impact Ministry will raise funds to
  gift every woman and man in the Jail.


  W﻿e are pleased to continue this tradition in 2024.
