This week we received some really great news. After filing our paperwork last month in March, we quickly received official to establish Impact Ministry as a nonprofit organization!

Our mission has always been twofold, to serve as Christian stewards and to enable people to fulfill their own missions. Impact Ministry's nonprofit status will allow us to pursue both of these goals.

Going forward, we anticipate several important milestones.

1. Expansion of our board.
2. Establishment of official programs.
3. New charitable endeavors.
4. Press campaign and news coverage.

We'd like to thank all of you who have been involved so far - we could not have done this without you. And as we look to the future, we are excited to think about all the ways in which we can grow in community and communion.

Please follow us online, join our mailing list, and spread the word.
