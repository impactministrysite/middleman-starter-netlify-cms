Each of these women graduated from my class CGA. Each and every one of them started off with a hard surface, just not wanting to listen. At the end of the course they were smiling and giving their all, and they want to continue doing this program.

This is Tasha and her future fiancé. She was doing hard prison time. She had been beaten and had every bone broken in prison, and was hospitalized.
